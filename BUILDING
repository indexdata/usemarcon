Building in Windows command line:

Run win\build_vc8.bat (VC++ 2005). Make sure the build environment is 
properly set up first (if not by default, run vcvars32.bat or such).
There are also build files for VC++ 2003 (win\build_vc7.bat) and 
VC++ Toolkit 2003 (win\build_vct.bat), but they are outdated and 
don't handle PCRE.

The build is based on MS VC++ 2005 projects in pcre, library and program 
directories:

pcre.vcproj
usemarcon_library.vcproj
usemarcon.vcproj

If you add the projects to a solution, add pcre as a dependency of 
usemarcon_library and usemarcon_library as a dependency of usemarcon 
(or whatever project uses usemarcon_library).

The build has been tested using MS Visual C++ 2005 under Windows XP.


Building in other systems:

First build PCRE by giving the following commands in the usemarcon base directory:

cd pcre
chmod +x CleanTxt config.guess config.sub configure depcomp Detrail install-sh perltest.pl PrepareRelease RunGrepTest RunTest 132html
./configure --enable-utf8 --enable-unicode-properties --disable-shared --disable-cpp
make
cd ..

If you're unable to build PCRE as it is in the USEMARCON distribution, you can download
the PCRE distribution from <ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/>,
unpack it to pcre directory (no version number) and try again. USEMARCON requires only
the basic pcre library.

Then build USEMARCON itself (again in usemarcon base directory):

chmod +x Makefile.am buildconf.sh config.guess config.sub configure install-sh missing mkinstalldirs usemarcon-config.in
./configure
make

If Autoconf, Automake and Libtool are present, the build system can also be created or updated by running buildconf.sh.
