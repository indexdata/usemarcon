USEMARCON PLUS SOFTWARE LICENCE AGREEMENT

Copyright © 2001 British Library/USEMARCON Consortium

This program is made available as unsupported free software; you can 
redistribute it and/or modify it under the following terms and conditions.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a 
"work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program 
or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed
as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this Licence; they are outside its scope.
The "Consortium", above, refers to: Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Netherlands, 
Instituto da Biblioteca Nacional e do Livro, Portugal and The British 
Library, United Kingdom.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source 
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice 
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to 
this Licence and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
recipients of the Program a copy of this Licence along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that 
you also meet all of these conditions:

   a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   b. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive 
      use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement 
      including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there 
      is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty).

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be 
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, 
then this Licence, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when 
you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same 
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the 
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this Licence, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise 
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works 
based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a 
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
scope of this Licence.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 
1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
      above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
   b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, 
      to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of 
      physically performing source distribution, a complete 
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
      customarily used for software interchange The source code for a work 
      means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. 
      For an executable work, complete source code means all the source 
      code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
      definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
      installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the 
      source code distributed need not include anything that is normally 
      distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
      components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
      which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
      the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made 
      by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering 
      equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts 
      as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are 
      not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicence, or distribute the Program except 
as expressly provided under this Licence. Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
modify, sublicence or distribute the Program is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this Licence. However, parties 
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this Licence will not 
have their licences terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this Licence until you have submitted 
the agreement to abide by its terms. However, nothing else grants you 
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this Licence. 
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on 
the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this Licence to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a licence from the original 
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms 
and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the 
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible 
for enforcing compliance by third parties to this Licence.

No Warranty

7. Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty 
for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when 
otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties 
provide the program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed 
or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of 
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as 
to the quality and performance of the program is with you. should the 
program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, 
repair or correction.

8. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing 
will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or 
redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, 
including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages 
arising out of the use or inability to use the program (including but not 
limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses 
sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate 
with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been 
advised of the possibility of such damages.
